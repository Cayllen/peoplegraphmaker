This is the repo for <https://peoplegraphmaker.com/>
Disclaimer: This is in no way clean code yet and still has to be cleaned up. There is also some code in it that can be removed

## Project Setup

Please use the following commands in the command line to handle the project.
Nodejs 18.16 required. I use a Mac, maybe the commands are different on Windows.

- npm install -> once for a first setup
- npm run dev -> runs a development server for display in the browser
- npm run build -> builds the app, the output is saved in .svelte-kit/cloudflare
