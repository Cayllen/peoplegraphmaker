# Project Setup

Please use the following commands in the command line to handle the project.
Nodejs 18.16 required. I use a Mac, maybe the commands are different on Windows.

- npm install -> once for a first setup
- npm run dev -> runs a development server for display in the browser
- npm run build -> builds the app, the output is saved in .svelte-kit/cloudflare

If you just want to change single items I recommend using the Github method + Cloudflare because here all the above steps are not necessary and you can just change the files on the Github-Website
